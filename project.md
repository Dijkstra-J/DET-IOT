Since I need to make something connected to the internet
I will see if I can get the arduino to control my spotify. For starters I wil see if I can make it pause and play with a button.
It would also be funny if I could visuallise the audio on an LED strip, not really related, just funny
If I get far enough, I will try to make it play and pause with a proximity sensor (if possible)

Sources that make me think some of this is even remotely possible:
